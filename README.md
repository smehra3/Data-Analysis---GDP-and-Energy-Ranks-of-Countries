# Data Analysis - GDP and Energy Ranks of Countries

Analyzed GDP Data for Countries along with Sciamgo Journal and Country Rank data for Energy Engineering and Power Technology.

Data Sources:
* List of indicators of energy supply and renewable electricity production from the [United Nations](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/environment/excel_file_tables/2013/Energy%20Indicators.xls) 
* GDP data from 1960 to 2015 from [World Bank](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD)

The analysis gives insights into:
* GDP Changes over the years for Top 15 countries (Scimagojr Rank) 
* Energy Supply per Capita for Top 15 countries and the mean of this metric across these 15
* Country with maximum % Renewable Energy
* Country with highest ratio of self citations to total citations from the top 15
* Correlation between the number of citable documents per capita and the energy supply per capita (also plotted)
* What countries are above or below median Renewable Energy % value
* Energy Supply distribution by Continent (considering the top 15)
* A visualization showing % Renewable vs. Rank. Additional attributes - size of the bubble corresponds to the countries' 2014 GDP, and the color corresponds to the continent.
